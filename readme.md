# Fluid Simulator [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/sopyb/fluidsimulation/badge/javascript)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/sopyb/fluidsimulation/overview/javascript)
This is a simple 2D fluid simulation using HTML5 canvas (since I can't figure out OpenGL.. yet).

Based on [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf) by Jos Stam.

### Why?
IDK Physics project go brr (and I'm a sado-masochist)

## How to run
Online [here](https://fluidsimulation.sopy.one/) (thanks GitHub Pages!)

**or**
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sopyb/FluidSimulation.git
cd FluidSimulation

# open index.html in your browser
firefox index.html
```
