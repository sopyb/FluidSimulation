# Fluid Simulator
This is a simple 2D fluid simulation using OpenGL (if I can figure it out). It might use the paper [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf) by Jos Stam.

### Why?
IDK Physics project go brr (and I'm a sado-masochist)

## TODO
- [ ] ?????

## How to run
```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sopyb/FluidSimulation.git
cd FluidSimulation

# make the build directory and cd into it
mkdir build
cd build

# compile the code
cmake ..
make

# run the program
chmod +x FluidSimulation
./FluidSimulation
```
